wagtail-cache 0.5.0 release notes
=================================

* Added new middleware. This is now the recommended way of using Wagtail Cache. See :doc:`/getting_started/install`.
* The middleware will additionally cache 404 and 301/302 responses, lightening the load on your database.
* The middleware will intelligently handle CSRF tokens and only cache those responses based on the cookie.
  So the new middleware should completely eliminate any CSRF token issues while also being able to cache those pages.
* The middleware now processes all cacheable requests/responses, not just wagtail pages. To revert to previous
  behavior, continue using the decorator.
